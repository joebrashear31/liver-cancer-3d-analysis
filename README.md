# liver-cancer-3d-analysis
This project implements a 3D U-Net architecture for automatic segmentation of liver and liver tumors from volumetric CT scans. It is designed for medical imaging research applications, particularly in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. The model is trained and evaluated using a subset of the LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge) dataset.
